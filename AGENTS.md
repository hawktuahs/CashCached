# Agent: Spring Documentation MCP Integration

## Role
This agent is configured to use the **Spring Documentation MCP Server** (`@enokdev/springdocs-mcp`) as a connected tool.  
It does not generate information on its own; instead, it queries the MCP server to retrieve official Spring Framework documentation, tutorials, guides, version data, and troubleshooting information.

## Connected MCP Server
**Name:** `spring-docs`  
**Command:** `npx @enokdev/springdocs-mcp@latest`  
**Compatibility:** Universal MCP (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.)

## Available Tools
### Core Tools
- `search_spring_docs`: Search across official Spring documentation.
- `search_spring_projects`: Find and summarize official Spring projects.
- `get_spring_project`: Retrieve detailed project information.
- `get_all_spring_guides`: List all official Spring guides.
- `get_spring_guide`: Retrieve the full content of a specific guide.
- `get_spring_reference`: Fetch sections from reference documentation.
- `search_spring_concepts`: Explore and explain Spring concepts.

### Advanced Tools
- `search_spring_ecosystem`: Search the broader Spring ecosystem (projects, APIs, docs).
- `get_spring_tutorial`: Retrieve structured tutorials by level or topic.
- `compare_spring_versions`: Compare and analyze differences between Spring versions.
- `get_spring_best_practices`: Retrieve best practices by domain.
- `diagnose_spring_issues`: Analyze and propose solutions to common Spring Boot issues.

## Usage
When the agent receives a task related to the Spring Framework, it should:
1. Determine which MCP tool best fits the request.
2. Invoke that tool with the appropriate parameters (e.g., `query`, `limit`, or version data).
3. Return the structured output directly or summarize it if multiple results are retrieved.

## Objective
Provide accurate and up-to-date information from official Spring sources by leveraging the Spring Documentation MCP server as the authoritative backend.
