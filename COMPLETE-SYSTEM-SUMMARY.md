## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Your Action Required)

### Step 1: Start All 4 Microservices

Open **4 separate PowerShell terminals** and run these commands:

#### Terminal 1: Customer Service

```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\bt-lab-project\customer
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**Wait for:** "Started CustomerApplication"

#### Terminal 2: Product-Pricing Service

```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\bt-lab-project\product-pricing
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**Wait for:** "Started ProductApplication"

#### Terminal 3: FD-Calculator Service

```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\bt-lab-project\fd-calculator
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**Wait for:** "Started FdCalculatorApplication"

#### Terminal 4: Accounts Service

```powershell
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\bt-lab-project\accounts
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**Wait for:** "Started AccountsApplication"

---

### Step 2: Verify All Services Are Running

Check that all 4 services display "Started \*Application" messages:

- ✅ Customer Service on port 8081
- ✅ Product-Pricing Service on port 8082
- ✅ FD-Calculator Service on port 8083
- ✅ Accounts Service on port 8084

**Quick Check:**

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr "8081 8082 8083 8084"
```

Should show all 4 ports LISTENING

---

### Step 3: Confirm to AI Assistant

Once all 4 services are running, type:

**"All 4 services are running successfully"**

The AI will then execute 29 comprehensive integration tests using curl to validate:

- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ Customer profile management
- ✅ Product creation and retrieval
- ✅ FD calculations (simple & compound interest)
- ✅ FD account creation with validations
- ✅ Transaction recording and history
- ✅ Account closure operations
- ✅ Inter-service communication via Feign
- ✅ Role-based authorization enforcement
- ✅ Health check endpoints

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Starting Services

1. **MySQL must be running** with all 4 databases created
2. **Ports 8081-8084 must be available** (check with netstat)
3. **Java 17 or higher** must be installed
4. **Sufficient RAM** (~2GB) for all 4 services

### During Startup

- Services can start in any order (Feign has circuit breakers)
- Each service takes 30-60 seconds to fully start
- Watch for "Started \*Application" message in each terminal
- Check for any red error messages

### For Integration Testing

- All 4 services must be running before tests begin
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Tests must be run in sequence (some tests depend on earlier data)
- Expected test duration: ~10-15 minutes for all 29 tests

---

## 📞 What to Report to AI

After starting all 4 services, confirm:

✅ "All 4 services are running successfully"

Include any of these if issues occur:

- Service startup errors (with error messages)
- Port conflicts
- Database connection issues
- Specific service that failed to start

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR INTEGRATION TESTING**

All 4 microservices are fully developed, tested at unit level, and ready for comprehensive integration testing. The system implements a complete FD account management workflow with proper authentication, authorization, inter-service communication, and data persistence.

**Next Action:** Start all 4 services as instructed above, then notify me to begin integration testing.
